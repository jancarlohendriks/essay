There I found you with your curious eyes crossing my sight every five seconds. My mind could not stop wondering what it was that made me feel such attraction between us. I only knew that it was there. After some gyomgyom and drinks it felt like our bodies could not sit so far of each other for much longer. Suddenly I found myself next to you, flowing into each other's mind, without being able to set my eyes away from you. Everyone was gone and time had stopped. In you, I saw kindness and tenderness, but without naivety. It felt like going for a walk with an old friend.</p> <p>Time has flown by, and I got to learn way more about you. My first impression held true, you are a wonderful woman, so much in the inside as in the outside. You are smart, strong and independent. Fearless and inspiring. All qualities I strive for. I also got to learn about your past, and the wounds which you carry. Marks in your soul coming from less valuable people. You carry them with pride, because they have made you who you are. But I know they have caused you great sadness and also doubt new people into your life. I do not blame you.</p> <p>You have also taken a deep look into my soul, even deeper than I thought I could let anyone. You did so bluntly but with great care, even though I am scared to death to let anyone go so deep. I feel I can trust you with my own heart and go deeper.</p> <p>Time will dictate how far we can go, but the experiences we have built together so far already speak by themselves. I can only keep discovering what makes you so attractive to me in all senses of the word. I want to do so with as much care as you have done, and make sure you do not lose yourself in the process. I am not here to take anything from you, I only want our hearts to grow bigger and stronger. Whatever the future holds up for us, I believe it will be positive. I believe so because we have built a very strong core, we have poured our hearts and created a safe place for us to be ourselves. We are dreamers, but we are realistic, and that is for me the formula to fly very far distances.</p> <p> I trust that if any of us gets stuck in the way, we will help each other out. And if we are the one stucking the other, we will know when to let go. Not because we do not care, but because we owe that love and respect to each other. </p> <p>Loves, JC.</p> </div>   </main> <script type="module" src="index.e9a2d1b4.js"></script><script src="index.b5e7c14d.js" nomodule defer></script> </body></html>
